## Setup
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run MongoDB with Docker `docker run -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb -d mongo`
- Set the required environment varibles

## Test
- Run `npm run test`

## Run
- Run `npm run compile` and `npm run start`

- Client Auth
- Redis caching (depending on requirements)
